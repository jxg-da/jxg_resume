# Josh Gittelman resume 2022
My name is Josh Gittelman, and I'm looking for a job in data analysis.

I conducted independent and collaborative research for over 20 years in both industry and academia, with over a dozen publications and one patent. During the last 8 of those years, I wrote software (IGOR Pro) to conduct experiments, including data acquisition, statistical analysis, and figures for presentation and publication. 

With strong communication skills and a strong back, I recently left a warehouse gig at United Tile, Portland, where I: 

moved tons of tile (literally), 

learned to drive a forklift, and 

used my unique position to write custom software (Python) to improve efficiency in the United Tile warehouse.
